                INSPACE ateliar Architects is recognized for the ability to
                shape space and light with great contextual sensitivity and to
                catalyze the unique qualities of each project to create a
                concept-driven design at multiple scales, from minimal
                dwellings, to university works, to new hybrid models of
                urbanism.

                <u>Idea and Function</u>
              </p>
              <p>
                INSPACE ateliar Architects’ philosophy is centered around a
                specificity in approach to design. In each project, the firm
                explores new ways to integrate an organizing idea with the
                programmatic and functional essence of a building. Rather than
                imposing a style upon different programs, sites, and climates,
                the unique character of a project becomes the starting point for
                an architectural idea. The concept acts as a thread connecting
                disparate parts with exact intention.

                <u>Site</u>
              </p>
              <p>
                The site of a building is more than a mere ingredient in its
                conception. It is its physical and metaphysical foundation.
                Building transcends physical and functional requirements by
                fusing with a place, by gathering the meaning of a situation.
                Architecture does not so much intrude on the landscape as it
                serves to explain it. Architecture and site should have an
                experiential connection, a metaphysical link, a poetic link.

                <u>Light, Material and Detail</u>
              </p>
              <p>
                While anchoring each work in its specific site and circumstance,
                INSPACE ateliar Architects endeavors to obtain a deeper
                beginning in the experience of time, space, light and materials.
                The phenomena of the space of a room, the sunlight entering
                through a window, and the color and reflection of materials on a
                wall and floor all have integral relationships. The materials of
                architecture communicate through resonance and dissonance, just
                as instruments in musical composition, producing thought and
                sense-provoking qualities in the experience of a place. With
                each project, the firm is inspired to create inventive details
                and experiment with new materials.
